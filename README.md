# üöÄ 3D Rubik's Cube

An interactive 3D Rubik's Cube game built with pure JavaScript and the **Three.js** library. This project is optimized to run directly on GitHub Pages.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Smooth 3D Rendering:** Powered by WebGL and Three.js.
- **Full Camera Control:** Rotate, pan, and zoom around the cube with mouse or touch.
- **Light & Dark Themes:** With user preference saved to `localStorage`.
- **Solve Timer:** Tracks the time it takes to solve the cube.
- **Time History:** Click the timer to view a history of your solve times.
- **Color Customization:** Change the color of each of the six faces from the settings menu.
- **Optimized Responsive Design:** Features a distinct, touch-friendly layout for mobile devices and a spacious layout for desktops.
- **Professional Project Structure:** Clean, modular, and maintainable code.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

This project requires no build tools or server. Simply open the `index.html` file in your browser.

### Deploying to GitHub Pages:
1. Create a repository named `Rubik-s-Cube` on your `GeekNeuron` GitHub account and push these files.
2. Go to your repository's `Settings` > `Pages`.
3. Under the `Branch` section, select your main branch (e.g., `main`) and click `Save`.
4. After a few minutes, your project will be live at: **https://GeekNeuron.github.io/Rubik-s-Cube/**

## üó∫Ô∏è Future Roadmap

- [ ] Implement full cube move logic (rotating faces with mouse drag).
- [ ] Implement a proper scramble algorithm.
- [ ] Implement a solve algorithm (or a simple "reset" button).
- [ ] Add smooth animations for face rotations.
